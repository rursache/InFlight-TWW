## Description
InFlight is a simple taxi flight timer mod that lets you know how long it will take to get to your destination. Other mods may provide a similar feature, however, InFlight is a lightweight alternative that, in most cases, is leaner, faster and uses a lot less memory (which is the main motivation behind InFlight).

## Features:
- Take-off confirmation
- Many customization options for the look of the timer bar
- Support for Druid-only and some other special flight paths
- Already has most flight times
- Learns new flight times or updates existing flight times when taxis are used
- Flight times added to tooltip on flight map

## How to Use:
InFlight is LoadOnDemand to use less memory when not needed
'/inflight', right-click on the timer bar, or check interface options to customize
Shift left-click and drag to move the timer bar
